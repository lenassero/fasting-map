# fasting-map

*Where do people fast the longest in the month of Ramadan in 2017?* 

I have scraped sunrise and sunset data for around 240 countries (using this [website](https://www.islamicfinder.org/) and this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_in_alphabetical_order)). 

The jupyter notebook shows the step of the process.

And [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nasser.benab#!/vizhome/Wheredopeoplefastthelongestin2017/FastingMap) is the map I created with the data.
